This is readme  file about IoT project - Facebook Likes monitor.

Breif idea: If a Facebook user  likes a particular page (in this case, embdded101.sg), eventually buzzer will buzz and LED glow  for each likes. The hardware setup based on Raspberry Pi + Groove Pi shiled.

The Groove shiled has connected to Temperature sensor,Groove Light sensor, Grove buzzor and Groove LED. 
Raspberry Pi and Grove Pi shiled and all the sensors are powered by 5V/ 2 Amp power adapter. Another option power from PC/laptop USB port.
